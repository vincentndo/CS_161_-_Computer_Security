a) First, we find the attack vector. That is we can implement DNS spoofing as following:

Step 1. Make spoof packet by writing pcap_tool.py

Step 2. Runt ./pcap_tool.py

Step 3. Make CSR by running openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout email.priv -out email.req

Step 4. Sign certificate by running ./sign email.priv email.req -out email.x509

Step 4. Run ./local_webserver email.x509 email.priv to get the secret
